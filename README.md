# Model Parameter Tuning Using Grid Search and Random Search

This Jupyter notebook is a comprehensive resource for implementing both grid search and random search techniques to optimize model parameters. It is tailored for educational purposes and practitioners aiming to improve model accuracy through effective hyperparameter tuning.

## Overview

The notebook demonstrates the setup and execution of both grid search and random search methodologies using Python and Scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`. These techniques are vital for identifying the best parameters that enhance model performance.

## Key Features

- **Parameter Setup**: Outlines the hyperparameters to be tuned and specifies the range of values for each.
- **Model Configuration**: Utilizes a placeholder model, which can be replaced with any Scikit-learn compatible model.
- **Search Implementations**:
  - **Grid Search**: Detailed setup of `GridSearchCV` including multiple parameters and how to run the search over all possible combinations.
  - **Random Search**: Setup of `RandomizedSearchCV` for searching over a random selection of parameters.
- **Result Analysis**: Techniques for extracting and displaying the best parameters and evaluating model performance.
